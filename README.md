<h1 align="center">TelephonySpoofer - Spoof all things networking!</h1>

<p align="center">An all-in-one, feature-rich module for Android devices to spoof cellular information, including eSIM compatibility! Powered by Xposed and sideloaded with LSPosed. ❤<br></p>

> [!TIP]
> Looking to use this module on Android 15+ or newer devices? You can use this maintained LSPosed mirror [here](https://github.com/JingMatrix/LSPosed) (thanks JingMatrix!)

## Features
- Spoof cellular information, including carrier data, cellular service, and more.
- Mock eSIM compatibility for non-supported devices (this will NOT allow you to use eSIM's, only spoof it).
- Easy installation with LSPosed (must have a rooted device w/ Xpsoed).
